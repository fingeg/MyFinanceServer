# MyFinanceServer
MyFinance is an app to manage the fincance for multiple projects or activities at the same time.

## Aim of the project
To be able to manage the finances of multiple activies or projects and send the bills of the results or of parts of it to specific people.

### Example
If you are the one who is paying everything in a project with for example two people, 
you can just add all payments to this project and send in the end or at any time a bill over half the amount.

Your project partner can see every payment listed and eventuelly with descriptions, so everthing is logically and fair splitted and you get all your owed money back.
